Poznan University of Technology
Jacek Eichler

Text Protocol based on Java and TCP protocol. There is also a report attached, unfortunately it is written in polish. Here you have a captured transmission:

OP- operation
ST- status
N1- number1
N2- number2
OI- operation ID
ID- session ID
TS- timestamp

Blue colored parts means packets sent by server, red by client
